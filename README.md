# Gantry_scanner
The gantry scanner based on gimbal is a hardware setup that can be used to acquire the ultasound images of excised tissue or organ for better analysis. This assist the pathologist to improve their accuracy in tumor analysis by providing the location from where they have to cut the tissue for analysis. This also helps the researchers to acquire the ultasound images of different tissue/organ and use these dataset to solve various research problems.

Low cost gimabal based ganrty:
For createting the gimbal based setup we have design and implemented the multiple 3D model includeing the enclosure and gimbal based gantry header that can hold the ultrasound transducer and move in differenct angles for acquiring and predicting the probability of dieseased tissue/organ.

Process:
To execute the code for testing first we acqurire the ultrasound images using gimbal basaed gantry. Then train these images to predict the optimal tumor location and probability of disease using deep learning model. Then we integrate the model in out setup to predict the tumor location based on our algorithm.
